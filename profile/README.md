## Hi there 👋

Thanks for checking out Power's work on Github.

If you're interested in our public open source work, you'll find it here and details of our thoughts about open-source in [our OSS guide](https://tech.powerhrg.com/oss-guide/).

If you're interested in our private proprietary work, you should definitely [come join us](https://techatpower.com/) - we have all kinds of different challenges available for you.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
